# Unhandled Error in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in HTML when using the `innerHTML` property with an undefined variable.  The error is silent, but leads to unexpected behavior in the browser.  It's crucial for developers to handle potential undefined variables to prevent this type of error.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains JavaScript code that attempts to assign an undefined variable `myUndefinedVariable` to the `innerHTML` of a div element.  This results in an error that is not explicitly thrown by JavaScript, but may lead to an empty div or other unpredictable results, often with no error reported in the browser's developer console.  

## Solution

The `solution.html` demonstrates a solution to prevent such errors.  It involves checking for the variable's existence before using it with `innerHTML` and handling potential undefined cases.
